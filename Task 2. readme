✅ TASK 2 REPORT
Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response

By: Kshitij Gupta
Role: Cybersecurity Intern – Future Interns

📌 Introduction

Security Operations Centers (SOCs) are responsible for continuously monitoring systems, detecting suspicious activities, and responding to security incidents in real time.

In this task, I simulated the role of a SOC Analyst by analyzing security logs using a SIEM platform (Splunk). The goal was to identify malicious activities, classify incidents based on severity, and prepare an incident response report with remediation recommendations.

This task helped me understand how real-world SOC teams detect threats and respond effectively.

🛠 Tools & Environment

SIEM Tool: Splunk (Free / Local Installation)

Operating System: Windows

Data Source: Custom simulated security logs

Log Types Analyzed:

Authentication logs

System activity logs

Malware detection alerts

Privilege escalation events

📂 Log Ingestion

Sample security logs were manually uploaded into Splunk and indexed under:

source = SOC_sample.log
sourcetype = Uncategorized


After ingestion, logs were analyzed using Splunk Search Processing Language (SPL).

🔍 Alert Analysis & Findings
🚨 Incident 1: Brute Force Login Attempt

Search Query:

action=login_failed


Observation:

Multiple failed login attempts for user alice

Same external IP: 203.0.113.45

Attempts occurred within a short time window

Classification:

Incident Type: Brute Force Attack

Severity: High

Impact:

Risk of account compromise

Possible credential stuffing attempt

🚨 Incident 2: Malware Detection

Log Evidence:

action=malware_detected threat=Trojan ip=10.0.0.5


Classification:

Incident Type: Malware Infection

Severity: Critical

Impact:

System compromise

Possible data exfiltration

Internal network threat

🚨 Incident 3: Unauthorized File Access

Log Evidence:

action=file_accessed file=/etc/passwd ip=10.0.0.5


Classification:

Incident Type: Sensitive File Access

Severity: High

Impact:

Exposure of system credentials

Indicates possible privilege abuse

🚨 Incident 4: Privilege Escalation Attempt

Log Evidence:

action=privilege_escalation user=eve ip=10.0.0.5


Classification:

Incident Type: Privilege Escalation

Severity: Critical

Impact:

Unauthorized administrative access

Full system compromise risk

📊 Incident Summary Table
Incident	Type	Severity
Multiple login failures	Brute Force Attack	High
Trojan detected	Malware Infection	Critical
Access to /etc/passwd	Sensitive File Access	High
Privilege escalation	Privilege Abuse	Critical
🛡 Incident Response Actions
Immediate Actions

Block malicious IP addresses

Isolate infected host (10.0.0.5)

Disable compromised user accounts

Reset affected credentials

Containment

Quarantine malware-infected system

Restrict administrative privileges

Monitor lateral movement attempts

Eradication & Recovery

Remove malware

Patch vulnerable services

Restore systems from clean backups

🔐 Remediation Recommendations

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

Implement account lockout policies

Apply least privilege access

Deploy EDR and antivirus monitoring

Regularly audit authentication logs

Continuous SIEM alert tuning

🎯 Conclusion

This task provided hands-on experience with SIEM-based security monitoring and incident response workflows. By analyzing real-style logs in Splunk, I was able to detect brute force attacks, malware activity, privilege escalation, and sensitive file access attempts.

This exercise strengthened my understanding of:

SOC operations

Alert triage

Incident classification

Security log analysis

Incident response lifecycle
